## 100 - About the web-based editor

The web-based editor introduces a lightweight editing experience that runs entirely in your browser. With the web-based editor, you can navigate files and source code repositories from GitHub, and make and commit code changes. You can open any repository, fork, or pull request in the editor.

The web-based editor is available to everyone for free on GitHub.com.

The web-based editor provides many of the benefits of Visual Studio Code, such as search, syntax highlighting, and a source control view. You can also use Settings Sync to share your own VS Code settings with the editor. For more information, see "[Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync)" in the VS Code documentation.

The web-based editor runs entirely in your browser’s sandbox. The editor doesn’t clone the repository, but instead uses the [GitHub Repositories extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_github-repositories-extension) to carry out most of the functionality that you will use. Your work is saved in the browser’s local storage until you commit it. You should commit your changes regularly to ensure that they're always accessible.

You must be signed in to use the web-based editor.
