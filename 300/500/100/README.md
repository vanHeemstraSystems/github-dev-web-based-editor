- The web-based editor is currently supported in Chrome (and various other Chromium-based browsers), Edge, Firefox, and Safari. We recommend that you use the latest versions of these browsers.

- Some keybindings may not work, depending on the browser you are using. These keybinding limitations are documented in the "[Known limitations and adaptations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/codespaces#_known-limitations-and-adaptations)" section of the VS Code documentation.

- ```.``` may not work to open the web-based editor according to your local keyboard layout. In that case, you can open any GitHub repository in the web-based editor by changing the URL from ```github.com``` to ```github.dev```.
