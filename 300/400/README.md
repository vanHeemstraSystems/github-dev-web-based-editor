# 400 - Using extensions

The web-based editor supports VS Code extensions that have been specifically created or updated to run in the web. These extensions are known as "web extensions". To learn how you can create a web extension or update your existing extension to work for the web, see "[Web extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/web-extensions)" in the VS Code documentation.

Extensions that can run in the web-based editor will appear in the Extensionsâ€¯View and can be installed. If you use Settings Sync, any compatible extensions are also installed automatically. For information, see "[Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync)" in the VS Code documentation.
