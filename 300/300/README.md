# 300 - Using source control

When you use the web-based editor, all actions are managed through the Source Control View, which is located in the Activity Bar on the left hand side. For more information on the Source Control View, see "[Version Control](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol)" in the VS Code documentation.

Because the web-based editor uses the GitHub Repositories extension to power its functionality, you can switch branches without needing to stash changes. For more information, see "[GitHub Repositories](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_github-repositories-extension)" in the VS Code documentation.
